# Email Classifier

This is my first Naive Bayes Mini-Project.
In this project, I will try to build an email classifier using scikit-learn lib. 


Disclaimer! The dataset used in this project is part of the ML course that I have attended. I am by no means claiming the ownership of that free resource. I used the resource for the sake of the study. It was provided to me for free as open source material.


## Dataset

For this project I used an open source dataset.
To recreate this project use the initial version of the project.
The initial commit contains python code that will unzip the dataset.
Just place the downloaded dataset within the project's root dir and run the practice.py script.

[Dataset Download Link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz)

Python command to run the script once you place the downloaded data set into the cloned project root.
```shell
python3 practice.py
```

## Tools Info

I have re-built the tool presented to me in the course material.
The tool was written in python2, and it used outdated. Its dependencies used obsolete major versions. 
Therefore, I had rebuilt it to fit this practice project.

Tool imports ROOT_DIR from config file. 
Config uses OS lib to grab the root dir of project.
It is sufficient setup for this mini project prototype.
